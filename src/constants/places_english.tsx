  details: `It was thanks to the work of a group of Nasa natives, who acted as master builders, that this place was built between 1673 and 1682 by order of the Bishop Cristobal Bernaldo de Quirós Mazo. The Bishop hired mestizo architects from Santafé, who would guide the work of the natives in this renowned corner of the fifth street. 
  \nThis construction is also colloquially known as the Nose of Popayán, and it was not always used as what it is today, since in its ground floor there was the first Baptistery of the cathedral, and besides, at some point, the building was used as a jail for priests and monks while a final sentence was passed.`,

  details:`I have always felt a great fascination for this bridge, which goes from the Bolivar neighborhood to the center of the city. Its name may be due to the fact that many years ago, travelers had to bow their heads to climb up a steep slope that was there before its construction, when people entered the city through the Royal Road of the Northern Tollhouse. 
  \nThe bridge has twelve Semicircular arches of different sizes, with views of the arcades or the stone-paved streets and the surrounding greenery.`,
  details1:`The construction, of poetic quality, as some of the wise inhabitants would say, was created during the Republican Period: Between 1868 and 1873, under the leadership of an Italian priest known as Brother Serafín Barbetti.

  \nThe thing was like this: the illustrious bishop Bernaldo de Quiróz Mazo gave me the license to build this temple, I was once what was commonly known as a freed slave. 
  \nI must regret that the earthquake of 1885 seriously affected the building, but later it was rebuilt to be affected again by the 1925 earthquake. 
  \nFinally, our city, already accustomed to so much telluric movement, was witness to the semi-destruction of the temple due to the earthquake of Holy Thursday on March 31, 1983. As better days came, it was restored thanks to the efforts made by Archbishop Samuel Silverio Buitrago Trujillo.`,

  \nThis place was built by the Payanese architect Marcelino Pérez de Arroyo by the end of the XVIII Century. 
  \nA lot of what makes up the place today was rebuilt under the direction of Mr. Álvaro Pío Valencia, son of the poet, given that the force of the earthquake in 1983 damaged it seriously.
